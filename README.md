# Acceptance Criteria Workshop



Context:



Jamie has two kids, Bob and Mary. Every week Jamie, sends Bob and Mary to buy groceries to a supermarket.  The kids get a shopping list and some cash to do the grocery shopping.



Here is our user story:



As a parent, I want my kids to do grocery shopping once a week so they learn to help with the family chores



Current acceptance criteria: The items of the shopping list should be bought. Everything should work fine.



Bob and Mary have been recently complaining that the acceptance criteria is not clear enough and they need a more precise definition.



Can you help them improve it? Make any necessary assumptions including the items at the supermarket
